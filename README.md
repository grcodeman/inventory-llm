## ðŸš€ InventoryÂ LLM

A sleek web app combining:

- **Inventory Management**  
  Keep track of your items across locations in real time.  
- **AI Chatbot Interface**  
  Ask to read or modify your inventory via natural languageâ€”behind the scenes it generates the right API calls.

### ðŸ“¸ Demo

*Example: a basic food inventory on the left, with our chatbot on the right reading your fridge contents and crafting APIâ€‘call blocks.*

### ðŸ“¦ Available API Calls

Your assistant can use the following operations to update the inventory:

- **`create(name, amt, loc)`**  
  Create a new item called `name` with quantity `amt` at location `loc`.  
- **`delete(item)`**  
  Remove an existing inventory item.  
- **`move(item, fromLoc, toLoc)`**  
  Move an item from one location to another.  
- **`set(item, amt)`**  
  Override an itemâ€™s quantity to `amt`.  
- **`change(item, delta)`**  
  Increase or decrease an itemâ€™s quantity by `delta`.  

Whenever the bot proposes changes, it will:

1. Summarize the intended adjustments for the user.  
2. List each API call in `{ â€¦ }` notation, parsed into a block by our UI.  
3. Ask you to confirm before applying them by pressing check.
